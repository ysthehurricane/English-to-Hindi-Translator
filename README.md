# English-to-Hindi-Translator

In this project, I build a deep neural network that functions as part of a machine translation pipeline. The pipeline accepts English text as input and returns the Hindi translation. The goal is to achieve the highest translation accuracy possible.

## Description

To translate a sentence of English text to Hindi, I have built a model using encoder decoder architechture with Long short-term memory (LSTM).
Following pipeline that can help to complete this projects:
- Import Dataset and explore it
- Applied necessary Data Preprocessing steps
- Prepare Data for Encoder and Decoder
- Built Encoder and Decoder architechture
- Built a Model
- Predict
